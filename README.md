# React SomaFM Player

https://somafm.com

Unofficial player, but streams from the same source. 

Thank you Soma for running such an awesome, ad-free radio <3


## Set up & Run

Clone the repo and open it up in a terminal.

`npm install -g create-react-app`

`npm install`

If you're on linux make sure your node is up to date, the apt repository is still at like version 4!

Includes a neat little visualizer thing.


Original player here: https://github.com/jmonta01/somafm-webplayer - Thanks for keeping it open source, Jason!

## Design 

The design is a work in progress, see my current mockup on figma
